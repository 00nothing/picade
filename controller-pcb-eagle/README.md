Eagle files for the Picade controller PCB
=========================================

You will need to install the Sparkfun (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries), Adafruit (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library), and Pimoroni (https://github.com/pimoroni/eagle-parts-library) parts libraries for Eagle.

The Picade controller PCB is based on the ATmega32U4 AVR (similar to the Arduino Leonardo - in fact we use the same bootloader!) it adds an audio amplifer using the MAX98306 which allows for one stero input and auto switches between headphones (if plugged in) and the provided speaker output.
